# Maximum-Diversity-Problem-using-GRASP-with-Path-Relinking
Implementing a heuristic algorithm to solve a combinatorial optimization problem using Python code that implements a GRASP algorithm with and without Path Re-Linking for the Maximum Diversity Problem (MDP).

Developed a method to create paths between elite solutions collected with the application of the GRASP.
Paths are obtained in a similar way like standard local search but with a specific target (guiding solution), as determined by the Path Relinking methodology.
Finally, compared the results obtained using GRASP with and without Path Relinking.
